# Avalanche Forecasting in the Pejo Ski Area: A Data-Driven Approach Using Support Vector Machines

Snow avalanches are fast-moving snow masses that can cause severe damage to infrastructure and loss of life,
 making them one of the most dangerous natural hazards in mountain regions.
 The prediction of snow avalanches is a crucial issue in Alpine regions, significantly impacting public safety
 and the economic well-being of mountain communities. By accurately predicting avalanche occurrences, fore
casters help protect lives, minimize damage to property, and guide outdoor enthusiasts in making informed
 decisions. This process involves analyzing a variety of factors, such as snowfall patterns, weather conditions,
 and terrain features, to assess the stability of snowpack and evaluate potential hazards. As mountainous
 areas attract skiers, climbers, and hikers, reliable avalanche forecasts are crucial for preventing accidents
 and promoting safer recreational activities in these breathtaking yet potentially dangerous environments.
 While traditional forecasting methods are often reliable, they mainly depend on expert judgment and em
pirical techniques, which can introduce subjectivity and limit their scalability. Recently, physically based
 models have been proposed to enhance objectivity and consistency in avalanche forecasting. However, their
 effectiveness at the local level is often limited by data quality and a lack of good spatial representation.
 This thesis explores the potential of a data-driven approach to help local avalanche forecasters in their
 decision-making. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model has been used to classify daily natural avalanche
 release probability for the Pejo Ski Area. The model uses traditional nivo-meteorological data as input,
 including well-known variables that significantly affect snow stability. Key challenges in predicting avalanches,
 such as imbalanced datasets and the non-linear interactions between the nivo-meteorological features affecting
 snow stability, are addressed to improve the model’s reliability and practical usefulness.
 The focus is on applying the model on a restricted area with limited data available, such the Pejo Ski area
 and evaluating its performance in real-world forecasting. The results indicate that Support Vector Machines
 (SVMs) are effective decision-support tools, demonstrating strong predictive capabilities in distinguishing
 between avalanche and non-avalanche events. The performance metrics for the test dataset indicate an F1
score of 0.827 and an ROC-AUC of 0.880, highlighting a strong ability to accurately classify avalanche events.
 Additionally, this thesis looks into incorporating model interpretability techniques, like SHAP (SHapley
 Additive exPlanations) tools, to help bridge the gap between automated predictions and the trust needed
 from experts. These tools help forecasters understand the reasons behind the model’s outputs, making the
 usually opaque “black-box” nature of machine learning clearer and increasing confidence in its practical use.
 The findings suggest that machine learning can enhance avalanche forecasting by working alongside tra
ditional methods, especially when combined with understandable insights. This research contributes to the
 development of data-driven tools in snow science, aiming to improve risk management and safety for the
 public in mountainous areas.
